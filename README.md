ðŸ§© Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find)
Disjoint Set Union (DSU), also known as Union-Find, is a data structure that keeps track of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) sets. It supports two primary operations efficiently:

Find: Determine which set a particular element belongs to.

Union: Merge two sets into a single set.

ðŸ“š Use Case
DSU is widely used in problems involving:

Detecting cycles in graphs (like in Kruskal's Algorithm)

Network connectivity

Grouping problems

Finding connected components

ðŸš€ Features
Path Compression in find() for efficient root lookups.

Union by Rank in union() to keep tree height minimal.

Near-constant time operations (almost O(1) per operation with inverse Ackermann function).
ðŸ“ˆ Time Complexity
Operation	Time Complexity
Find	O(Î±(N))
Union	O(Î±(N))
Where Î±(N) is the inverse Ackermann function â€” practically constant for all reasonable N.

ðŸŒŸ Applications
Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm)

Dynamic connectivity

Percolation problem

Equations possible (Leetcode)
